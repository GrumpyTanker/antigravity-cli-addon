# Antigravity CLI Add-on Wiki

Welcome to the internal documentation for the **Antigravity CLI** Home Assistant Add-on. 
This wiki explains the architecture, components, and key design decisions.

## Architecture Overview

The Add-on runs in a Docker container inside Home Assistant Supervisor. It exposes a web-based terminal interface with a dedicated backend.

### 1. Web Frontend (`index.html`)
The frontend is built with vanilla HTML/JS/CSS to ensure minimal overhead. It contains:
- **Terminal Viewport:** Renders the TTYD shell session via `<iframe>`.
- **Keyboard Shortcut Menu:** An on-screen menu (`#footer`) providing quick access to complex shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, PgUp, /resume, etc.) essential for mobile users or quick macros.
- **Scroll Inertia Fix:** Includes a custom script to inject smooth kinetic scrolling and fix Apple/Android virtual keyboard issues within the TTYD `xterm.js` canvas.
- **Modal Overlays:** Features a full-screen `fixed` overlay (`#loader-modal`) with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` for blocking user interaction during critical operations (like backup/restore).

### 2. Python Backend (`upload.py`)
This is a lightweight HTTP server (`http.server`) running alongside `ttyd`. It handles:
- **File Uploads:** Intercepts image/file uploads from the UI and passes them into the current active terminal session (`/upload`).
- **Tab Management:** Allows killing terminal sessions when tabs are closed (`/kill`).
- **Self-Updating:** Pulls the latest version from GitHub automatically via `/update_cli`.
- **Backup & Restore System:**
  - `/export_backup`: Streams a `.tar.gz` archive of `root/.gemini`, `data/.gemini`, and `config/.gemini` directories directly to the network `stdout` to avoid RAM/disk exhaustion.
  - `/import_backup`: Accepts an uploaded `.tar.gz` file, stops the AI agent process, wipes the current memory, extracts the backup, and reboots the agent.

### 3. NGINX Reverse Proxy (`nginx.conf`)
NGINX acts as the gateway between Home Assistant Ingress and the internal services.
- Ports: Listens on `8099`.
- Routes `/ttyd/` to the internal `ttyd` daemon on port `7681`.
- Routes all other traffic to the Python backend on port `8000`.
- **Cache-Busting:** Crucially configured with `add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache...` on the root location to prevent Home Assistant Companion apps from caching `index.html` aggressively.

### 4. Startup Script (`run.sh`)
The entrypoint script that:
1. Copies default configurations to `/opt/antigravity`.
2. Restores persistent storage from Home Assistant's `/data` volume.
3. Starts the Python backend, the Node.js AI agent, and `ttyd`.
4. Keeps everything running via a bash `wait` loop.

## Development & Testing Workflow

Because Home Assistant Supervisor caches images and Ingress caches static files, the typical development cycle is:
1. Edit code locally.
2. Push to GitHub and sync files to the local `\\addons\antigravity-cli` Samba share.
3. For Python/Shell changes: **Rebuild** the Add-on from the Supervisor panel.
4. For HTML/JS/CSS changes (Hot-swapping): Copy `index.html` directly to `/opt/antigravity/html/index.html` inside the running container and force-refresh the browser (`Ctrl+F5`).

## Roadmap & Changelog
- **Recent Update:** Integrated full Backup/Restore UI with full-screen blurred loading modals. Prevented OOM crashes by streaming the `tar` backup. Fixed mobile touch scrolling issues inside the terminal iframe.
